The project objective is to design, build, and operate a commercial-scale lithium extraction and refining facility to produce battery-grade lithium from domestic brine resources. The facility will have a significant production capacity of 25,000 tonnes of lithium carbonate equivalent (LCE) annually. The facility will include refining capabilities to convert the extracted lithium chloride (LiCl) from brine into battery-grade lithium carbonate (Li2CO3). The project will utilize proven DLE technology, support the domestic critical minerals supply chain, and create hundreds of high-skilled American jobs. The commissioning and operation of this facility will significantly bolster the domestic lithium supply chain by onshoring this critical component, reducing reliance on imports, mitigating geopolitical risks, and lowering costs to both manufacturers and consumers. The lithium produced by this facility can power up to 500,000 EVs and eliminate over 2.2 million metric tons of CO2 annually. TVR is a pioneer in the critical minerals space with the mission to become one of the largest, vertically-integrated critical minerals producers in the United States. While several companies have announced plans to mine lithium domestically, TVR is unique in its ability to bring lithium to market quickly and with minimal environmental impact. Currently, nearly all lithium is produced either through open pit mines or brine evaporation ponds. Both methods require immense surface areas. Unlike open-pit mining or evaporation ponds, TVR will produce lithium from brine using DLE. TVR’s facilities will require less surface area, produce no tailings associated with open-pit mines, and have minimal environmental impacts on local communities. Additionally, the extraction process and lack of heavy mining equipment results in a lower carbon footprint for TVR’s operations when compared to other proposed projects in the U.S. ","Battery Manufacturing & Energy Storage","Bowie County, TX; Redwater, TX; Hooks, TX; Texarkana, TX; Wake Village, TX; Nash, TX; De Kalb, TX; Leary, TX; New Boston, TX; Texarkana, AR; Red Lick, TX; Maud, TX"

Through a two-tiered system, FIERCE will develop the scaffolding for the following underlying program focus areas: Use-inspired Research and Development, Translation of Innovations to Practice, Workforce Development, Ecosystem Partnerships, and Indigenous Innovations. Use-inspired research projects within FIERCE will be used to develop solutions and tools for measuring and verifying their effectiveness to ensure they reduce atmospheric greenhouse gases. FIERCE will engage with all citizens to strengthen existing and create new distributed workforce development programs, especially in Indigenous communities who, as holders of large tracts of sovereign lands in the West, are essential partners to a climate-smart future beginning in the region. Finally, FIERCE will translate innovations to practice through strategic partnerships with regional economic development organizations, entrepreneurs, state agencies, and climate-smart incubators. Increasing concentrations of atmospheric greenhouse gases from a fossil-fuel-based economy have caused a dangerous increase in global temperatures causing megafires and megadroughts that have impacted community infrastructure, food and fiber availability, water quality and quantity, and human health. Climate-smart solutions that reduce greenhouse gas emissions, sequester carbon, and increase regional climate adaptation while maintaining or increasing economic output are required to solve these destructive problems. The FIERCE engine will research, develop, identify, and translate climate-smart solutions and products through a unique ecosystem of agricultural, forestry, energy, educational, and business development partners in the region. In the development phase, FIERCE will strengthen existing partnerships and build new relationships with direct funding sources that can infuse capital and invest long-term in the FIERCE Engine. Working groups for each of the FIERCE focal areas will convene to identify, synthesize, and prioritize regional projects and ideas for FIERCE to support in the growth phase. Outcomes of this work will generate publications and reports that will be used to guide further Engine development, strengthened partnerships committed to the climate change and societal goals underlying the FIERCE vision, and the foundation for a resilient ecosystem that fosters creativity, inclusion, and economically-viable solutions to climate change. This Development Award will enable the team to engage in a regional, collaborative planning process to prepare a future Engine to meet these goals.","AgTech, Bioproducts, & Food Production; Clean Energy & Climate Resilience","Latah County, ID; Farmington, WA; Onaway, ID; Genesee, ID; Bovill, ID; Deary, ID; Moscow, ID; Troy, ID; Viola, ID; Princeton, ID; Kendrick, ID; Potlatch, ID; Juliaetta, ID"

In classical computing, information is encoded and processed in bits that can exist in one of two states, typically depicted as 0 or 1, and each bit acts independently. Quantum bits (qubits) behave fundamentally different and can be placed in a superposition state, representing a combination of all possible configurations of the qubit. This can potentially solve complex problems beyond our current computing capability. Additionally, quantum systems can be entangled, which links the behavior of two separate items. This can increase quantum computing capability and provide unbreakable encryption in quantum communication. QISE has the potential to revolutionize all information science areas, and leadership in this field represents a huge economic opportunity. The region of service for this Development Award includes the states of Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming, which contain one of only two NSF-funded Quantum Foundries nationally, multiple existing quantum research groups, and multiple companies that are part of the Quantum Supply Chain producing not only quantum materials but also other photonic, electronic, cryogenic and classical computing components required to stabilize, encode and decode, transmit or interface with quantum computers and information systems. University-led use-inspired research will include investigating quantum devices by Boise State University's Quantum DNA group, new methods of designing and fabricating topological Josephson junction qubits by the University of Wyoming, two-dimensional quantum materials, and quantum networking by Montana State University.

Together, they form the Smart Logistics Engine. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted many chronic failure points in logistics systems stressed by multi-scalar economic, social, and natural crises. Solving these challenges at all scales and across the urban-to-rural spectrum is crucial to the future economic prosperity of the U.S. The Illinois-Indiana-Wisconsin-Missouri region is poised to lead in this sector because of its unique setting as a hub for all transportation modalities spanning river, air, road, and rail networks. This project is led by the Illinois Innovation Network, with Governors State University as the lead academic institution. Key partners across the state include Western Illinois, Southern Illinois University Carbondale, Southern Illinois University Edwardsville, University of Illinois Chicago, the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, and Eastern Illinois University. In recent years, companies have been forced to reconfigure their supplier locations to build resiliency while simultaneously seeking to satisfy the demand for rapid delivery without product shortages. During this time, 68% of small businesses cited supply chain disruptions as having moderate to significant impacts on their business, and 87% of consumers were impacted by shortages and rationing. To solve these issues, this project will focus on three core activities: (1) automation of logistics for truck middle-mile freight systems, (2) autonomous drones and electric vehicles deployment, and (3) inland waterway freight delivery systems. The team will center its planning around translatable research demonstrating automation as a systemic enhancement and research incorporating drone and electric vehicle technologies across industry clusters. It will use intelligent logistics and design thinking to engage port managers, community leaders, and private sector partners to develop a regional, urban-to-rural waterborne commerce system and inclusive labor market. The project also will identify strategies for reskilling and upskilling individuals whose career paths are disrupted by automation while ensuring that workers in local and sub-regional economies can attain long-term participation in new industry clusters.","Transportation, Logistics, & Construction","Will County, IL; Orland Park, IL; Channahon, IL; Frankfort, IL; Andres, IL; Goodenow, IL; Godley, IL; Peotone, IL; Woodridge, IL; Lakewood Shores, IL; Sunnyland, IL; Eagle Lake, IL; Marley, IL; Lockport, IL; Custer Park, IL; Lockport Heights, IL; Rest Haven, IL; Plainfield, IL; Rockdale, IL; Oswego, IL; Lemont, IL; Homer Glen, IL; Sauk Village, IL; Monee, IL; Braceville, IL; Crystal Lawns, IL; Minooka, IL; Plum Valley, IL; Fairmont, IL; Beecher, IL; Bolingbrook, IL; Coal City, IL; Crete, IL; Elwood, IL; Romeoville, IL; Shorewood, IL; Tinley Park, IL; University Park, IL; Aurora, IL; Joliet, IL; Frankfort Square, IL; Ingalls Park, IL; Willowbrook, IL; Ritchie, IL; Bonnie Brae, IL; Lorenzo, IL; Symerton, IL; Richton Park, IL; Dyer, IN; Manhattan, IL; Ridgewood, IL; Wilton Center, IL; Matteson, IL; Braidwood, IL; Diamond, IL; Naperville, IL; Crest Hill, IL; Arbury Hills, IL; Preston Heights, IL; New Lenox, IL; Wilmington, IL; Park Forest, IL; Steger, IL; St. John, IN; Mokena, IL"

1000000,"Regional Innovation Engines","Tufts University","NSF Engines Development Award: Accelerating A Just Energy Transition Through Innovative Nature-Inclusive Offshore Wind Farms","SDG","Middlesex County, MA","This Regional Innovation Engines Development Award is focused on advancing the science, engineering, economic models, industrial capacity, decision-making process, and regulations needed for the design and operation of nature-inclusive Offshore Wind (OW) underwater infrastructure (e.g. foundations and associated scour protection). Over the next ten years, about 2000 OW turbines are expected to be constructed off our nation?s eastern coastline from Massachusetts to Virginia at a cost of about $100 Billion. This brings great challenges and opportunities for the shared-use of our coastal waters. The marine ecosystem in this region is already under great stress due to climate change which has reduced biodiversity and fishing stocks; thereby, communities in this region are very concerned about additional stresses on the marine ecosystem that offshore wind may bring. MOCEAN (Mission is the OCEAN) is the lead for this NSF project, and it aims to: (i) make OW farm development a win for all (OW industry, fishers, coastal communities, ocean habitats); (ii) drive large-scale sustainable OW energy that will contribute greatly to achieving U.S. climate goals and ocean health; and (iii) catalyze the investment required to build and operate OW farms to address societal inequities. This project will engage industry, stakeholders, public officials, affected communities, and public and private decision makers to develop an effective strategic plan and innovation community to achieve MOCEAN?s mission. MOCEAN?s strategic plan and innovation community will be developed to support making significant advancements in science and technology; engineering, economic, and educational models; and associated policy drivers; the region of this community will include coastline areas from Massachusetts to Virginia. If the project succeeds in becoming an NSF Engine, then the advancements in science will range from the micro-to-macro scale, and these will include the formation of marine communities, marine biology, impact of stressors on habitats, the effect of different materials and coatings on marine growths, local ecosystems, as well as regional ecosystems. The advancements in technologies will include new sensing systems (e.g. eDNA, acoustic, image-based), robotics, coating systems, more durable materials, intelligent nature-inclusive scour protection, artificial reefs, and future-proof foundations. The advancements in engineering models will account for important factors that are presently ignored or insufficiently considered in practice (e.g. soil-foundation structure interaction, impact of cathodic protection on design life and the environment). For economics, the advancements will quantify the effect of local labor, environmental impact, and new blue technology within economic models that can be used in the decision-making process for the design and operation of offshore wind farms. In education, advancements will create new methods of engagement, support, and learning that lead to much greater participation of students and workers from marginalized communities in the New Blue Economy within MOCEAN?s region of service. The composition of the MOCEAN team was designed to make intellectual progress at the intersections between different fields, and to create system-of-system models. This Development Award will enable the team to engage in a regional, collaborative planning process to prepare a future Engine to meet these goals.","Water, Mariculture, & Blue Economy","Middlesex County, MA; Hopkinton, MA; Melrose, MA; Littleton Common, MA; Reading, MA; Maynard, MA; East Pepperell, MA; Boston, MA; Cambridge, MA; Winchester, MA; Burlington, MA; Cochituate, MA; West Concord, MA; Cordaville, MA; Ayer, MA; Shirley, MA; Brookline, MA; Chelsea, MA; Everett, MA; Lowell, MA; Malden, MA; Somerville, MA; Waltham, MA; Watertown Town, MA; Nashua, NH; Framingham, MA; Fitchburg, MA; Hanscom AFB, MA; Saugus, MA; Arlington, MA; Belmont, MA; Groton, MA; Pepperell, MA; Pinehurst, MA; Stoneham, MA; Townsend, MA; Wakefield, MA; Lynnfield, MA; Wellesley, MA; Needham, MA; Woburn, MA; Revere, MA; Lexington, MA; Medford, MA; Wilmington, MA; Newton, MA; Methuen Town, MA; Devens, MA; Hudson, MA; Marlborough, MA"
